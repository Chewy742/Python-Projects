# Python-Projects
A repository for personal and classroom projects coded in Python

Open the Jupyter Notebooks to see projects. Other files are csv files that are used in the projects. 

Topics include:   

  1. Stock Price Simulator: a Monte Carlo simulation that takes advantage of previous stock price data from large companies and predicts the trend of these stocks in the future. 
  
  2. CayleyTable : Shows the principles of inheritance in Python, using a complex mathematical tool called a Cayley Table - children of the Base Group class have different slightly different functions than a regular Cayley Table
  
  3. Machine Learning Project: a foray into machine learning that looks to change parameters to achieve better results. 
  
  4. Final Project - done for a class: Intro to Computing for Scientists and Engineers, includes projects such as transliteration, bit parity, and displaying data from csv files.
