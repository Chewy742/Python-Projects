# Python-Projects
A repository for personal and classroom projects coded in Python

Open the Jupyter Notebooks inside the different folders to see projects. Other files are csv files that are used in the projects. 

Topics include:   

  1. Stock Price Simulator: a Monte Carlo simulation that takes advantage of previous stock price data from large companies and predicts the trend of these stocks in the future. 
  
  2. CayleyTable : Shows the principles of inheritance in Python, using a complex mathematical tool called a Cayley Table - children of the Base Group class have different slightly different functions than a regular Cayley Table
  
  3. Machine Learning Project: a foray into machine learning that looks to change parameters to achieve better results. 
  
  4. Dictionary Class - implements a Dictionary that stores a set of information as a list of lists, designed so that it takes in a csv file. Allows you to both read and write easily to this csv file. 
  
  5. Spell Checker - given a dictionary.csv file, uses the file to spell check and provide suggestions for mispelled words, while also logging the amount of times you have used the suggested word as well. 
  
  6. Final Project - done for a class: Intro to Computing for Scientists and Engineers, includes projects such as transliteration, bit parity, and displaying data from csv files.
